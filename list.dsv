spear-phishing	n	a targeted attempt to steal sensitive information such as account credentials,financial information from a specific victim,often for malicious reasons. this is achieved by acquiring personal details on the victim such as their friends,hometown,employer,locations they frequent,and what they have recently bought online. the attackers then disguise themselves as a trustworthy friend,entity to acquire sensitive information,typically through email,other online messaging. this is the most successful form of acquiring confidential information on the internet. spear-phishing can easily be confused with phishing because they are both online attacks on users that aim to acquire confidential information. phishing is a broader term for any attempt to trick victims into sharing sensitive information such as passwords,usernames,and credit card details for malicious reasons. the attackers often disguise themselves as a trustworthy entity and make contact with their target via email,social media,phone calls (often called “vishing” for voice-phishing),and even text messages (often called “smishing” for sms-phishing). unlike spear-phishing attacks,phishing attacks are not personalized to their victims,and are usually sent to masses of people at the same time. t

the four sights	n	the four sights are four things described in the legendary account of gautama buddha's life which led to his realization of the impermanence and ultimate state of dissatisfaction of conditioned existence. according to this legend,before these encounters siddhārtha gautama had been confined to his palace by his father,who feared that he would become an ascetic if he came into contact with sufferings of life according to a prediction. however,on his first venture out of the palace with his charioteer channa,he observed four sights: an old man,a sick man,a corpse and a beggar ascetic. these obs ervations affected him deeply and made him realize the sufferings of all beings,and compelled him to begin his spiritual journey as a wandering ascetic,which eventually led to his enlightenment., [oe. four & sight]
